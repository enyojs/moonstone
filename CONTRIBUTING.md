line in your commits and pull requests.

If you're interested in introducing new kinds, you might also consider hosting your own repo
and contributing to the [Enyo community gallery](http://enyojs.com/gallery).

Below are specific guidelines to follow when contributing to the Moonstone library.

## Internationalization

Moonstone optionally uses the [ilib](http://jedlsoft.com/index.html) internationalization library (typically loaded via the [enyo-ilib](https://github.com/enyojs/enyo-ilib) wrapper) for localizing any strings used inside controls, as well as any locale-specific
date, time, and number formatting.

All user-visible strings in Moonstone controls should be wrapped with the `moon.$L("...")` wrapper function.  This will ensure localized strings are loaded from Moonstone resource files (as opposed to app-specific resource files when using `$L("...")`).

Any formatting of date, time, or numbers should use ilib when present.  However, use of `ilib` is not a mandatory prerequisite to using Moonstone, so any use of ilib should first check that ilib is loaded, and provide en-US fallback when appropriate.

## Modifications to CSS

Moonstone CSS is defined using parameterized LESS files.  Whenever you make changes to LESS files in Moonstone, you'll also need to re-generate and check-in the top-level .css file as well, to maintain backward-compatibility for environments that don't wish to use LESS.

You can re-generate the top-level moonstone.css and moonstone-light.css file as follows:

    cd lib/moonstone/css
    ../../../enyo/tools/lessc.sh ./all-package.js

NOTE: Since LESS generates relative URLs, it's important to run the `lessc.sh` script from the moonstone css folder.

Also note you only need to generate the .css file when you're ready to check in your changes.  During development, you can do all your testing modifying just LESS files if you include "less-xyz.min.js" in your app's debug.html file, which compiles the LESS client-side during loading:

    <script src="enyo/tools/minifier/node_modules/less/dist/less-1.3.0.min.js"></script>

Alternatively, there is also a "watch" mode for `lessc.sh`, which will automatically re-compile CSS based on any LESS dependency changes:

    cd lib/moonstone/css
    ../../../enyo/tools/lessc.sh -w ./all-package.js

In general, each control should have its own `MyControl.less` file which contains CSS rules pertaining to the control in question, with parameters useful for themability defined as descriptive symbolic variables in one of the variable files described below.

The following is detail around the structure and rules that should be followed to ensure all Moonstone controls support several different required variations:

### Color variations: _Dark, Light, and Neutral_

Virtually all Moonstone controls must support `dark`, `light`, and `neutral` color themes.  

Currently, an app may choose between the dark or light themes at build time via separate package.js files.  The dark theme is the default in `$lib/moonstone/package.js`.  The light them may be selected by choosing `$lib/moonstone/light-package.js` instead.  While the light and dark themes are mutually exclusive and rely on different compiled CSS, contols must adapt themselves at runtime to use the neutral theme when placed inside of certain containers (Popup, ContextualPopup, Drawer, ListActions, etc.), through the application of the `.moon-neutral` class.

The file inclusion structure that supports these themes is outlined below:

```
$lib/moonstone/package.js
+- css/package.js
   +- moonstone-dark.less
      +- moonstone-variables-dark.less
      +- moonstone-variables.less
      +- moonstone-rules.less

$lib/moonstone/light-package.js
+- css/light-package.js
   +- moonstone-light.less
      +- moonstone-variables-light.less
      +- moonstone-variables.less
      +- moonstone-rules.less

moonstone-variables-dark.less
+- dark theme variables

moonstone-variables-light.less
+- light theme variables

moonstone-variables.less
+- common variables, plus neutral-theme variables

moonstone-rules.less
+- common rules
+- Control1.less   // Individual control less use variables
+- Control2.less
+- ...
+- Controln.less
```

Any color value (for `color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, etc.) should be defined in a variable in the `moonstone-light.less` and `moonstone-dark.less` files, rather than directly in the widget file (regardless of whether the value actually differs today between the light and dark themes).  For example:

_Button.less_
	
```
.moon-button {
	...
	background-color: @moon-button-background-color;
	color: @moon-button-text-color;
}
.moon-neutral .moon-button * {
	background-color: @moon-neutral-button-background-color;
	color: @moon-neutral-button-text-color;
}
```
_moonstone-variables-dark.less_

```
@moon-button-background-color: #404040;
@moon-button-text-color: #a6a6a6;
```

_moonstone-variables-light.less_

```
@moon-button-background-color: #FFFFFF;
@moon-button-text-color: #4B4B4B;
```

_moonstone-variables.less_

```
@moon-neutral-button-background-color: #404040;
@moon-neutral-button-text-color: #a6a6a6;
```


### Font variations: _Latin and Non-Latin_

Moonstone controls are rendered using two different font sets, depending on the runtime-selected locale of the system. 

For "latin" locales (locales that predominantly use the latin alphabet, such as English, French, Spanish, etc.) are rendered using "Miso" (primarily for Header, Button, and Tooltip) and Museo Sans (for all other text).  These fonts are included in the moonstone library as web fonts, loaded via `@font-face` rules included in `moonstone-fonts.less` if the fonts are not found on the system.

Since Miso/Museo Sans are not full-unicode fonts, all other non-Latin locales will be rendered using `LG Display` if present on the system, or the default system font otherwise.

The `ilib` library will automatically apply `.enyo-locale-non-latin` to `<body>` when the system locale is a non-latin locale.  Thus, font classes should be defined to use Miso/Museo Sans by default, and include overrides to use `LG Display` when the `.enyo-locale-non-latin` class is applied.

Individual controls have two options of supporting this requirement to change fonts at runtime.

1. **Use standard font classes in JS**: 

	The `moonstone-rules.less` file includes a number of standard font classes that may be applied directly to controls via their `classes` property.  These classes have `.enyo-locale-non-latin` variants which select the correct font automatically.  This is the preferred approach.  Example:

	```
enyo.kind({
	name: "moon.Divider",
	classes: "moon-divider moon-divider-text",  // moon-divider-text will automatically change font based on locale
	...
});
	```
	Refer to the `FontSample.html` for a list and examples of these font classes.

2. **Mixin standard font classes in LESS**

	Alternatively, there are cases (especially when sub-kinding) where CSS specificity requires you to define a more specific selector in order for the correct style to be applied.  In this case, you may "mixin" a standard text class into your new rule, using the LESS mixin feature (simply include the class name including dot, followed by a semicolon).  However, note that when mixing in a class, that effectively copies the content of the class into the new rule.  As such, you will lose the ability for the font to change automatically based on locale.  So, when using font class mixins, you must always define an additional rule adding an `.enyo-locale-non-latin` selector, which mixes in the `.enyo-locale-non-latin` version of the standard text class.  Example:

	```	
.moon-expandable-input.open .moon-expandable-input-header {
	.moon-divider-text;
	...
}
.enyo-locale-non-latin .moon-expandable-input.open .moon-expandable-input-header {
	.enyo-locale-non-latin .moon-divider-text;
}
	```

IMPORTANT: Moonstone is a typographic-centered UI library, and thus it is important to limit the number of font variations to a small set for consistency and visual harmony.  Individual control CSS should avoid defining one-off `font-face` or `font-size` rules, and insetad should only select from the menu of standard font classes, using one of the two options above.

### Direction variations: _LTR_ and _RTL_

All Moonstone controls must support "right-to-left" (RTL) layout, in addition to the default "left-to-right" layout. 

Similar to fonts, the `ilib` library will apply an `.enyo-locale-right-to-left` class to `<body>` for this purpose.  The standard `.moon` class used on ever Moonstone app will automatically set the `direction:rtl;` CSS property, which reverses the HTML layout flow direction and applies other specific text flow rules accordingly.  Native browser support for the `direction` property covers 90% of the work of supporting RTL.

However, in most cases, any control CSS that specifically sets a `left` or `right` property asymmetrically will need to be reversed in RTL.  The following is a list of common properties that need reversing:


* padding-left/right
* margin-left/right
* border-left/right
* left/right (absolute/relative positioning)
* float: left/right
* text-align: left/right
* background-position: left/right

This can be simply accomplished by defining a second rule that resets the default property, and sets the opposite.  Examples:

```
.moon-header-left {
  float: left;
}
.enyo-locale-right-to-left .moon-header-left {
  float: right;
}
```

```
.moon-toggle-text-text {
  position: absolute;
  right: 0px;
  ...
}
.enyo-locale-right-to-left .moon-toggle-text-text {
  right: auto;
  left: 0px;
}
```

```
.moon-item.moon-formcheckbox-item {
  ...
  padding-left: 10px;
  ...
}
.enyo-locale-right-to-left .moon-item.moon-formcheckbox-item {
  padding-left: 0;
  padding-right: 10px;
}

```

#### RTL: When CSS isn't enough

There are a few rare cases where JS logic needs to be aware of whether the control is rendered in RTL or LTR.  Rather than sniffing the computed style for `direction` or checking for the `.enyo-locale-right-to-left` class on body (which would be bad for performance), we have added a `rtl` property to the enyo.Control prototype which will also be set to `true`  by `ilib` when applying the `.enyo-locale-right-to-left` class.  enyo.Control sub-kinds can simply check `this.rtl` on their instance to determine whether the control is in RTL or LTR mode.

## Samples

Every new control should be accompanied by at least one sample, pluggable into the [Enyo 2 Sampler](http://enyojs.com/sampler).  Read the [Sampler readme](https://github.com/enyojs/sampler) for details on how to go about adding new samples to the Sampler.

Guidelines for samples:

* Samples should live in a folder named `samples`, as a peer to the source
* Be sure to exercise useful API's and events of the control in the sample
* When one or more significantly different or interesting configurations of the control are available, include more than one instance in the sample to exhibit use of the different API's
* When resolving a bug, update the sample to ensure the original bug and resolution is testable
* Each sample should be registered in the following files:
	* `$lib/moonstone/samples/package.js` - for loading the required JS and CSS when running in the sampler
	* `$lib/moonstone/samples/manifest.json` - to indicate where the sample should be placed in the Sampler menu structure
	* Its own `MyControlSample.html` file, which loads and renders the sample for standablone testing
	
## Testing Samples

Samples should be tested both using their standalone `html` file, as well as in the Enyo 2 Sampler, in all variations described above.

Note, the Enyo 2 Sampler's "extras" menu has options for toggling the non-latin and RTL classes/settings at runtime, which is useful for testing your control in the variations described above.

To get set up to test Moonstone samples in the sampler, run the following next to your `lib` folder:

	git clone git@github.com:enyojs/sampler.git --recursive

Then point your browser here:

	http://<path-to-sampler>/debug.html?addSamples=../lib/moonstone/samples/manifest.json&debug=true&extras=true

From there, you can open the extras menu and toggle those settings on/off.

Alternatively, you can pretty easily just apply these classes this in the inspector like this:


```
// To turn on non-latin (caching previous value, for easy switching):
var orig = document.body.className; document.body.className += " enyo-locale-non-latin"
// To turn off non-latin:
document.body.className = orig;
```

```
// To turn on RTL (caching previous value, for easy switching):
var orig = document.body.className; document.body.className += " enyo-locale-right-to-left"

// To turn off RTL:
document.body.className = orig;
```

Note, the above RTL code only sets the CSS class on body; it does not set the `enyo.Control.prototype.rtl` flag, which is needed by a small number of controls to operate properly (Slider, FittableLayout, MarqueeText, etc.).  In this case, you would need to set a breakpoint before the control is rendered to force the `enyo.Control.prototype.rtl` flag to true, so that it is properly rendered in the new mode.

## Design Metadata

The Moonstone library should fully support use in the [Ares IDE](https://github.com/enyojs/ares-project).  Ares parses and makes all Enyo controls available in the drag-and-drop designer by default, however libraries may provide "designer metadata" by means of a `.design` file, which allows specifying default properties and other parameters used to improve the experience of using the control in the designer.

New controls should be added to the `$lib/moonstone/moonstone.design` file with any default configuration needed to make the control usable and user-friendly in Ares.  See the [Ares project](https://github.com/enyojs/ares-project) for more details.
