/**
	_moon.Image_ is a simple control that wraps an [enyo.Image](#enyo.Image) to
	provide proper alignment with text-based contols.

	In addition, _moon.Image_ optionally accepts [moon.ImageBadge](#moon.ImageBadge)
	client components, which are placed inside a container positioned over the
	image.  These badges are normally persistent, but may be shown or hidden based
	on spotlight focus, using the _showBadgesOnSpotlight_ property.
